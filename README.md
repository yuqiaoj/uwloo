# UWLoo 

Unfortunately, this website no longer works due to the discontinuation of the Heroku free tier.

## UWLoo: Rating Loos on the UW Campus

UWLoo is a review website for the washrooms("loos") of each University of Waterloo campus building.

This is my first fullstack project! It's a silly idea, but I think it could definitely come in handy for students who want to know where the best place to go is.

## Frontend

Built using React using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, visual components created using Material-UI V4, and queries made with Apollo Graph Platform.

## Backend

Map built using React Google Maps API. Database hosted on Heroku and accessed using a GraphQL API through Hasura.

## Special Thanks
